# Changelog

Notable changes per release. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/); versions follow
[semantic versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), with the usual 0.x
caveat that a minor bump may still change behaviour.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Saving in the metadata editor did nothing.** It asks before it writes, and
  that prompt was the one dialog in the app that stayed where it was declared
  instead of moving to the end of the document like every other overlay. At the
  same stacking level the editor — which does move — was painted over it, so
  the prompt sat behind the editor's dark backdrop: invisible, and the click
  meant for it landed on that backdrop. Pressing Save looked like it did
  nothing at all, because nothing is exactly what happened. Every confirmation
  asked from inside an open dialog was affected, not just this one.
- A successful metadata write could still be reported as an error: the list
  behind the dialog was reloaded inside the same guarded block as the write,
  so a list that failed to reload turned a finished save into an error message
  and kept the dialog open.

### Removed

## [0.4.0] — 2026-09-21

### Added

- **The stats page is a dashboard now.** Four numbers about the library —
  tracks, albums, artists, and how much of it has been played at least once —
  and two charts: the most played artists, and albums by decade. Both bars are
  walkable: a row leads to that artist or that decade. The artist numbers are
  added up from your most played tracks, because the server counts plays per
  track and not per artist, and the chart says so rather than pretending
  otherwise.
- **Metadata for many tracks at once.** Select rows in the song list,
  right-click, and set album artist, genres or the year for all of them —
  genres can be added to what each track already has instead of replacing it.
  Only what you fill in is written: everything left empty stays as it is on
  each track, and titles and track numbers are not offered at all, because
  they are not something several tracks share. A track the server refuses is
  counted and the rest still go through.

### Changed

- The Opus decoder now builds on libopus 1.6.1 instead of 1.3. The `opus`
  crate moved to a maintained `-sys` crate in August; the one it used before
  had been sitting untouched since 2021 and carries an "unmaintained" advisory
  (RUSTSEC-2026-0150). Nothing in the app had to change, and the binary grew
  by 80 KB.
- An update check now says in the log what it found — the version offered and
  the one it was compared against. The panel only ever shows the answer, and a
  diagnostic export should be able to answer the next question by itself.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-09-21

### Added

- **Volume normalization has an album mode.** Settings → Playback now offers
  off, per track or per album. Per album plays every track of an album at one
  gain, so a quiet piece stays quieter than a loud one — what the album was
  mixed for. Jellyfin only sends an album value after 10.11; without one the
  gain is the median of the album's tracks in the queue, which is the same
  constant offset even if the absolute level can sit a little off. A change
  takes effect from the next track.
- **Stop after this track, or after this album.** Right-click a queue entry:
  playback ends where you said it would, without a fade — the track finishes
  the way it was recorded and then it is quiet. The armed row is marked, and
  the gapless hand-off is held back for that one boundary so the track really
  does end. An album stop knows where its album ends, even when the queue
  continues with another one.
- **Every track list has the same right-click menu.** Album, playlist,
  favorites and search results had a few hover buttons and no menu at all;
  they now offer what the song list has offered all along — play, play next,
  add to the queue, add to a playlist, instant mix, go to album or artist,
  info, edit, download, delete — plus what only that list can do, such as
  removing an entry from the playlist it sits in or taking a track out of the
  favorites.
- **The playlists are in the sidebar**, and tracks and albums can be dragged
  onto them. Drag a row from the song list, an album's track list or the
  favorites — or a whole album from a grid — and drop it on a playlist to add
  it. A drag from outside the window is not accepted; only the app's own
  payload lights a playlist up.
- **The home page can be arranged.** Each row can be moved or hidden from its
  own heading; Settings → View lists them all, which is where a hidden one
  comes back from. A row the server has nothing for still stays out — that is
  not a setting, that is an empty row.
- **Jump to the playing track.** `J`, the command palette, or the pill that
  appears in the queue while the current entry is scrolled out of sight. The
  queue also opens on the playing track now, and follows along to the next one
  while it is on screen — but never while you are reading somewhere else in
  the list.

### Changed

- The update panel now shows what actually changed. `latest.json` carries the
  release's changelog section instead of a sentence pointing at a file the
  dialog cannot open.
- A failed update check says what went wrong in words: the releases page was
  unreachable, it holds no release for this platform, the download broke off,
  or — the one worth its own sentence — the download did not match the
  project's signature and was discarded. The technical detail stays in the log
  and in the diagnostic export.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-09-21

### Added

- **In-app updates.** The installed app can ask the release page whether a
  newer version exists — once per start, and that check can be switched off in
  Settings → Updates, where there is also a button to check on demand. An
  update is downloaded and verified against the project's minisign key before
  the installer is opened, so a swapped download cannot be installed even
  though the installer itself is not code-signed. It never runs while a track
  is playing or loading, because the installer closes the app, and the last
  playback report is flushed before it does. The portable build says it cannot
  update itself instead of turning itself into an installed copy.
- Releases now carry `latest.json` and the installer's `.sig`, which is what
  the update check reads. 0.1.0 has neither, so the step from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0
  is a manual download; every step after it is not.

### Fixed

- The Jellyfin play session is now minted per attempt at a track instead of
  once per queue entry. Playing the same entry again — repeat-one, jumping
  back, a queue restored after a restart — reported a start under a session
  the server had already been told was stopped, which left it unable to tie
  the reports to the right playback and to the transcode job it had started
  for it. A reopen (seeking inside a transcode, switching the output device)
  still continues the running session, because it is the same playback.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-09-21

First public release. Windows, Jellyfin 10.11 or newer.

### Playback

- Rust audio engine built on Symphonia and rodio: FLAC, MP3, Vorbis and WAV,
  with a libopus-backed decoder for Ogg-Opus. The WebView never touches audio.
- True gapless — the next track is opened ahead of the boundary and appended
  sample-accurately — and an opt-in crossfade with gain ramps.
- 10-band equalizer, volume normalization, and click-free pause and resume
  through a sample-accurate fade stage.
- Seeking inside a live server transcode, and a sleep timer with fade-out.
- Output device is selectable and falls back automatically when a device
  disappears, resuming at the same position.

### Library and queue

- Albums, artists and genres with an A–Z scrubber, virtualized grids,
  favorites, home rows, recently added, multi-disc handling and play counts.
- The queue lives in Rust as the single source of truth: shuffle, repeat,
  album shuffle, one-step undo, deduplication, played-cleanup — and it survives
  a restart.
- Playlists with full editing, drag-and-drop reordering, duplicate detection,
  transfer between playlists, and saving the current queue as a playlist.
- Search with history, instant mix, and similar artists.

### Discovery

- A Discover hub with random, mixes, long-not-heard, decade and artist
  drill-downs.
- Dynamic smart views: server-side filters you can save and, when you want them
  frozen, materialize into a static playlist.
- Read-only Collections, and an Auto-DJ that keeps the queue going from a
  track, artist, genre, album or playlist seed.

### Now playing and visuals

- Synced lyrics at line and word level, as a panel or fullscreen, with a
  per-track offset when the file's timing is off.
- A now-playing backdrop derived from the cover art.
- A Butterchurn (MilkDrop) visualizer with 393 bundled presets, a preset
  browser, beat sync, sensitivity and quality controls, and a projector window
  for a second monitor. The online preset pack stays behind an explicit opt-in
  and a pinned checksum, because presets are executable code.

### Desktop

- Windows SMTC, so media keys and the system now-playing overlay work.
- System tray with a background mode, and a frameless mini player.
- Hidden or minimized, the WebView is suspended and memory drops to roughly
  115 MB while playback continues from the Rust side.
- ListenBrainz scrobbling, a command palette, and fully configurable keyboard
  shortcuts.

### Look

- AMOLED dark: a true-black ground, a short ladder of near blacks, hairlines
  rather than light edges. There is one theme, deliberately.
- The accent follows the playing cover by default and is kept readable against
  black; eight presets and a custom color are available instead.
- View density and layout presets, skeletons, empty states, an offline banner,
  and a stale-while-revalidate cache so navigation renders instantly.

### Security

- Self-signed servers are handled by per-server SHA-256 certificate pinning
  through a custom rustls verifier. There is no blanket "accept invalid
  certificates" switch.
- Auth tokens live in the OS credential store, never in the DOM and never in
  SQLite.
- A Content-Security-Policy restricts the WebView to the app's own origins.

### Known limitations

- The installer is not code-signed, so SmartScreen reports an unknown
  publisher.
- Windows only for now. Nothing in the architecture is Windows-specific, but
  no other platform has been built or tested.
- No offline downloads, casting, podcasts, multiple servers at once, or
  Subsonic/Navidrome backends. These are deliberate non-goals for 1.0.
